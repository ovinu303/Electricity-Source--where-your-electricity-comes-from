This Python project utilizes the Electricity Maps free-tier API to provide insightful information about energy production source(s) for any given city. It offers a user-friendly interface to explore the percentage of fossil fuel-free energy production and a detailed breakdown of various energy sources(coal\natural gas\solar\thermal\nuclear etc) that contribute to the queried city's electricity consumption.

Features:

1) City-based Energy Analysis: Enter any city name to get a detailed list of its sources of  energy production.
2) Fossil Fuel-Free Percentage: Displays the percentage of energy produced from non-fossil fuel sources.
3) Detailed Energy Source Breakdown: Provides a comprehensive list of all energy sources, including the net wattage and percentage of electricity produced by each source.
4) Sorted Results: Energy sources are ordered by their net energy production percentage for easy analysis.

Prerequisites:

1) Python 3.6 or higher
2) An Electricity Maps API key (Free tier)
